# Crystal-Game
In the Crystal Collector Game, the computer chooses a random target number and assigns each of the crystals with a random value. When the user clicks on a crystal, their score will increase by that crystal's value. The object of the game is to match the user's score with the target score. You lose if the user's score goes over the target score.  Each win and loss is also tracked. Good luck and enjoy!
